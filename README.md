# CustomTabbar
CustomTabbar allows you to create custom tabbar easily. For example, you can add a custom image at the center of the tabbar.


## API

### InterfaceBuilder(StoryBoard)
You need to create a subclass of CustomTabBar.
Add `viewDidLoad` to the subclass and call `addCenterButtonWithImage(_:highlightImage:)` with the images you want to show.
